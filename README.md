Classify various plant diseases using CNN

Getting affected by a disease is very common in plants due to various factors such as fertilizers, cultural practices followed, environmental conditions, etc. These diseases hurt agricultural yield and eventually the economy based on it.Â 

Any technique or method to overcome this problem and getting a warning before the plants are infected would aid farmers to efficiently cultivate crops or plants, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Thus, disease detection in plants plays a very important role in agriculture.

The PlantVillage Dataset
We use a publicly available and quite famous, the PlantVillage Dataset. The dataset was published by crowdAI during the "PlantVillage Disease Classification Challenge". 

The dataset consists of about 54,305 images of plant leaves collected under controlled environmental conditions. The plant images span the following 14 species:

Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato.

The dataset contains a total of 38 classes of plant disease and 1 class of background images listed below:

Apple Scab
Apple Black Rot
Apple Cedar Rust

Due to the limited computational power, it is difficult to train the classification model locally on a majority of normal machines. Therefore, we use the processing power offered by Google Colab notebook as it connects us to a free TPU instance quickly and effortlessly.
